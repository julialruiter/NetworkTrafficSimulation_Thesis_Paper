\subsection{class TrafficManager:}

\begin{alltt}
\textbf{__init__}(self, network_config) -> None
Establishes an instance of TrafficManager to run on the given 
network structure.
Attributes:
    graph:  Network object that the TrafficManager runs on.
    timestamp:  Simulation timestamp.

\textbf{add_car}(self, car)
API function:  place car (dictionary object) onto the network's 
waiting queue.
Please note that the current iteration of add_car only supports 
placement directly onto Edges (identified by "start_edge").

\textbf{get_all_paths_A_to_B}(self, start_edge_ID, end_edge_ID)
API function:  Given a start and end Edge id, return a list of 
all valid paths that do not repeat Edges.

\textbf{get_node_edges_in_out}(self, node_ID)
API function:  lists the IDs of inbound and outbound edges for 
a particular node.
This information can also be found via 'get_snapshot()'.

\textbf{get_path_distance}(self, path)
API function:  Given the ordered list of Edges as "path", 
evaluate the total distance it would take to travel.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is 
traveled.

\textbf{get_path_minimum_time}(self, path)
API function:  Given the ordered list of Edges as "path", 
evaluate the minimum time it would take to travel (in ticks) 
given each Edge's speed limit.
Minimum time is calculated assuming a car is able to travel 
the maximum speed per edge unencumbered.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is 
traveled and includes any Node-crossing time penalties.
\textit{Note:  time cost does NOT include Node-crossing time out of the 
final edge as the Car is expected to exit the Network before the 
Edge's end.}

\textbf{get_shortest_path_A_to_B}(self, all_paths_list)
API function:  Given all_paths_list (a list of paths from A to 
B as calculated using self.get_all_paths_A_to_B()),
returns the path with the shortest total distance in terms of 
length.

\textbf{get_snapshot}(self)
API function:  outputs list of nodes, edge attributes, car 
attributes.
Output is formatted in such a way that it can be used as input 
for a new simulation.

\textbf{get_theoretical_fastest_path_A_to_B}(self, all_paths_list)
API function:  Given all_paths_list (a list of paths from A to 
B as calculated using self.get_all_paths_A_to_B()),
returns the path with the minimum total travel time (assuming no
congestion).

\textbf{get_timestamp}(self)
API function:  returns (sequential) state number.

\textbf{pause_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  forcefully halts the Car associated with 'car_id' 
until a 'resume_car' call is received.
No cars behind it may pass.

\textbf{remove_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  removes the Car associated with 'car_id' from
the simulation.
This is done by forcing it into Car.status = 'Removed from 
simulation'.

\textbf{resume_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  allows the Car associated with 'car_id' to 
resume moving.

\textbf{tick}(self)
API function:  advance state of network by one unit of time.


\end{alltt}

\section{Hidden Module: traffic\_network.py}

This module creates and runs an instance of a Network object when a simulation is created via starting a \textbf{TrafficManager} instance.  The main item here is \textbf{class Network}, which  contains, creates, and collects several dependent components (\textbf{class Node}, \textbf{class Edge}, and \textbf{class Car}).  \\

\noindent The functions here should be hidden from the user.  Instead, the user should call for changes using the\textbf{TrafficManager} API.  Internal functions belonging to the \textbf{traffic\_network} module can be seen below:

ensuring that any Cars received are valid OR can be made valid 
using the DEFAULT_car_values_config.json file.

\textbf{add_edge}(self, edge)
Imports edge(s) from given edge dictionary.
If both the start and end nodes are already in the network, then 
the edge will be added.
Any Edge attribute values not given in the edge object (imported) 
will instead be assigned from the imported defaults file:
edge_default_config.
\textit{Note:  there are no default values for id, start_node_id, nor 
end_node_id as these are an Edge's unique identifiers.}

\textbf{add_node}(self, node)

the network.

\textbf{all_paths_depth_first_search}(self, current_edge_ID,

Given a list of paths from A to B (ex: as calculated using
self.all_paths_depth_first_search()),
returns the "best" path with regards to input metric.
Currently supported input metrics:
    \textbf{'Fastest'}: best path = minimum total travel time (assuming 
    no congestion).
    \textbf{'Shortest'}: best path = shortest total distance in terms of 
    length.
    \textbf{'Random'}:  pay no heed to metics, choose an available path 
    at random.
Future versions may include metrics like:
    \textbf{'Fastest_now'}: best path = minimum travel time after 
    accounting for current Network congestion.

\textbf{get_Network_pointer}(self)
Returns tick index (which aligns with TrafficManager tick).

\textbf{get_edge_id}(self, edge_id)

its corresponding Edge object.

\textbf{get_global_tick}(self)
Returns a pointer to this Network instance.
Useful for directly generating cars OR keeping track managing 
multiple simulations at once.

\textbf{get_node_from_id}(self, node_id)

maximum speed per edge unencumbered.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is traveled 
and includes any Node-crossing time penalties.
\textit{Note:  time cost does NOT include Node-crossing time out of the 
final edge as the Car is expected to exit the Network before the 
Edge's end.}

\textbf{remove_edge}(self, edge)
Placeholder for future software version:
Will remove an Edge and all of its associated Cars from the 
Network.

\textbf{remove_node}(self, node)
Placeholder for future software version:
Will remove a Node and all of its associated inbound/outbound 
Edges from the Network.

\textbf{restore_tick_potential}(self)
Resets the tick_potential to its maximum value for all Cars on 
the Network.

\textbf{tick}(self)
Shuffles the order in which Node ticks will be processed with 
each global tick to ensure no node is favored.
\textit{Note:  global tick != Node tick.  Global tick is the unit of 
time until the next state of the simulation, 
while Node tick the proportion of that time that its components 
can move uninterrupted.  
Node ticks will occur until the sum of their durations reaches 
that of a global tick/no further movement is possible.}

\section{Optional Module:  \\ UnderlyingNetworkGenerator.py}
In the absence of a pre-made graph to run the simulation on, the user can elect to use this module to generate a network.  This method of Netowrk generation may be useful for some particular use cases where it is beneficial to create a graph with many Nodes and Edges sharing the same properties.\\

\noindent The current version of this module supports the creation of Erdős-Renyi random graphs OR complete, bidirectional graphs.  This module will be improved later to support other mathematical network types.

\textbf{__init__}(self) -> None
Class containing various functions for generation Network objects 
for the simulation to run on.
A Network can also be provided via custom JSON file instead.

\textbf{create_ER_network_default_values}(self, number_nodes,
probability_joining=0.5)
Creates an Erdos Renyi Network based on the given parameters:
A each pair of nodes has a probability_joining (0 < p < 1) of 
being connected in an ER Network.
As this is a directional Network, each pair will be considered 
separately per direction.
This Network uses the following default values:
    probability_joining = 0.5     # can be overwritten by input
    node.intersection_time_cost = 0
Please note that this NetworkGenerator function only generates 
the barebone structures necessary for a Network. 
All additional attributes will be loaded via
"DEFAULT_edge_values_config.json" during the simulation process.

\textbf{generate_complete_bidirectional_network_default_values}(self,
number_nodes)
Generates a complete Network consisting of number_nodes Nodes, 
each connected to every other Node in both directions.
This Network uses the following default value:
    node.intersection_time_cost = 0
Please note that this NetworkGenerator function only generates 
the barebone structures necessary for a Network. 
All additional attributes will be loaded via
"DEFAULT_edge_values_config.json" during the simulation process.
output_Network_dictionary(self, node_dict, edge_dict)
Returns dictionary containing all Node and Edge information for 
the newly generated Network.

\subsection{class GeneratorNode:}

\begin{alltt}
\textbf{__init__}(self, id) -> None
Contains all attributes necessary for creating a network 
intersection (Node).
Attributes:
    id:  Unique ID associated with this Node object.
    intersection_time_cost:  Value representing time in ticks 
    required to cross intersection.  0 <= value < 1.
\end{alltt}

\subsection{class GeneratorEdge:}

\begin{alltt}
\textbf{__init__}(self, id, start_node_id, end_node_id, edge_length=None,
max_speed=None, max_capacity=None) -> None
Contains all attributes necessary for creating a road segment 
(Edge).
Attributes generated in all NetworkGenerator functions:
    \textbf{id}:  Unique ID associated with this Edge object.
    \textbf{start_node_id}:  Node from which this Edge originates.
    \textbf{end_node_id}:  Node from which this Edge terminates.
Attributes generated only in probabilistic NetworkGenerator 
functions:
    \textbf{edge_length}:  Physical length of the Edge (ex: meter length 
    of a road).
    \textbf{max_speed}:  (optional) Unit speed limit of the road.  
    Without obstructions, this is the maximum distance a Car 
    can move on this Edge in one tick.
    \textbf{max_capacity}:  (optional) Maximum number of Car objects
    allowed on the Edge.
