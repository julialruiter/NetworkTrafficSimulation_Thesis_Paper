\label{Appendix}

\par This sections contains excerpts from the Network Traffic Simulator code and an overview of the system this software was created and tested on.  The version you see here is the complete documentation for version 1.0.0, released  1 July 2022.  \\

\noindent The features found in this version were created to meet (and exceed) the requirements and expectations set  by Universiteit Utrecht staff and serves as a graduation thesis project for their MSc Applied Data Science program.  This release, while a bit barebones on the generator side, sets up a complete, adaptable framework for urban traffic simulations (and other use cases!). \\

\noindent Please check the project's repository (below) for the latest instantiation:

\section{Dependencies}
So much as possible, libraries have been kept to the standard Python libraries.  This means that the current Network Traffic Simulator software version has no external dependencies.

\section{System Specifications}
This software was created and tested on a machine with the following specifications.  Though no official stress-testing has been done for this publication, this information may be relevant in analyzing any metrics reported in follow ups: \\

This section contains the full expected config file structure referenced in\autoref{Manual}, \textit{"\nameref{Manual}"}.  Mandatory fields for the configs have been bolded:

\subsection{Network object format}

        \},

\section{Example Simulator Setup Code}
\label{SampleCode}

\par To translate the Simulation example from \autoref{Manual}, \textit{"\nameref{Manual}"} into code, we may write the following:

\begin{alltt}
from \textbf{Traffic} import \textbf{TrafficManager}
\textbf{import} json

if __name__ == "__main__":

    # import configs
    network_config_original = None
    try:
        with open("./configs/road_data.json") as 
                  original_json_file: 
            network_config_original = json.load(
                                      original_json_file)
    except Exception as E:
        print(E)
        
    network_config_newlane = None
    try:
        with open("./configs/road_data_extralane.json") as 
                  newlane_json_file: 
            network_config_newlane = json.load(newlane_json_file)
    except Exception as E:
        print(E)

    car_config = None
    try:
        with open("./configs/generated_cars.json") as car_file:  
            car_config = json.load(car_file)
    except Exception as E:
        print(E)
        
    # batch cars
    cars_batch_1 = car_config["car_list"][0:400]
    cars_batch_2 = car_config["car_list"][400:1200]
    # ...etc
    
    # set up the 2 simulations
    tm_original = TrafficManager(network_config_original)
    tm_newlane = TrafficManager(network_config_newlane)
    
    # advance timestamps for simulation 1, adding cars when 
          necessary, outputting snapshots when necessary
    for car in cars_batch_1:
        tm_original.add_car(car)
    for tick in range(1800):     # 30 min
        tm_original.tick()
        if tick \% 60 == 0:
            with open(str(tm_original.get_timestamp()) + 
                          '_snapshot.json', 'w') as f:
                json.dump(tm_original.get_snapshot(), f)
    
    # ...etc for remaining car and time batches
    #  repeat "advance timestamps" for tm_newlane
\end{alltt}

\section{API Module: Traffic.py}
This module instantiates a simulation instance and exposes all necessary/desired functions for interacting with the simulation once it is running:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%---------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Hidden Simulation Module: traffic\_network.py}

This module creates and runs an instance of a Network object when a simulation is created via starting a \textbf{TrafficManager} instance.  The main item here is \textbf{class Network}, which  contains, creates, and collects two dependent components (\textbf{class Node} and \textbf{class Edge}.  \\

\noindent The functions here should be hidden from the user.  Instead, the user should call for changes using the\textbf{TrafficManager} API.  Internal functions belonging to the \textbf{traffic\_network} module can be seen below:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%---------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Hidden Simulation Module: network\_cars.py}

\par This module creates and stores a car object.  A car is created when called into existence by an API call via the \textbf{Traffic} module.  While the \textbf{network\_cars} module is fully dependent on the \textbf{network\_traffic} module to move, car objects can exist separately.  Thus,  \textbf{network\_cars} is imported into the \textbf{network\_traffic} module to allow for object-network interaction. \\

\noindent Once again, the functions here should be hidden from the user.  Instead, the user should call for changes and additions using the\textbf{TrafficManager} API.  Internal functions belonging to the \textbf{network\_traffic} module can be seen below:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%---------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Optional Module:  \\ UnderlyingNetworkGenerator.py}

In the absence of a pre-made graph to run the simulation on, the user can elect to use this module to generate a network.  This method of Netowrk generation may be useful for some particular use cases where it is beneficial to create a graph with many Nodes and Edges sharing the same properties.\\

\noindent The current version of this module supports the creation of Erdős-Renyi random graphs OR complete, bidirectional graphs.  This module will be improved later to support other mathematical network types.
