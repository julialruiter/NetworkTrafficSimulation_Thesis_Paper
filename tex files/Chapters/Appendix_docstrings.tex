\par This sections contains excerpts from the Network Traffic Simulator code.  The version you see here is the complete documentation for version 1.0.0, released  1 July 2022.  \\

\noindent The features were created to meet (and exceed) the requirements and expectations set  by Universiteit Utrecht staff and serves as a graduation thesis project for their MSc Applied Data Science program.  This release, while a bit barebones on the generator side, sets up a complete, adaptable framework for urban traffic simulations (and other use cases!). \\

\section{API Module: Traffic.py}
This module instantiates a simulation instance and exposes all necessary/desired functions for interacting with the simulation once it is running:

\subsection{class TrafficManager:}

\begin{alltt}
\textbf{__init__}(self, network_config) -> None
Establishes an instance of TrafficManager to run on the given 
network structure.
Attributes:
    graph:  Network object that the TrafficManager runs on.
    timestamp:  Simulation timestamp.

\textbf{add_car}(self, car)
API function:  place car (dictionary object) onto the network's 
waiting queue.
Please note that the current iteration of add_car only supports 
placement directly onto Edges (identified by "start_edge").

\textbf{get_all_paths_A_to_B}(self, start_edge_ID, end_edge_ID)
API function:  Given a start and end Edge id, return a list of 
all valid paths that do not repeat Edges.

\textbf{get_node_edges_in_out}(self, node_ID)
API function:  lists the IDs of inbound and outbound edges for 
a particular node.
This information can also be found via 'get_snapshot()'.

\textbf{get_path_distance}(self, path)
API function:  Given the ordered list of Edges as "path", 
evaluate the total distance it would take to travel.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is 
traveled.

\textbf{get_path_minimum_time}(self, path)
API function:  Given the ordered list of Edges as "path", 
evaluate the minimum time it would take to travel (in ticks) 
given each Edge's speed limit.
Minimum time is calculated assuming a car is able to travel 
the maximum speed per edge unencumbered.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is 
traveled and includes any Node-crossing time penalties.
\textit{Note:  time cost does NOT include Node-crossing time out of the 
final edge as the Car is expected to exit the Network before the 
Edge's end.}

\textbf{get_shortest_path_A_to_B}(self, all_paths_list)
API function:  Given all_paths_list (a list of paths from A to 
B as calculated using self.get_all_paths_A_to_B()),
returns the path with the shortest total distance in terms of 
length.

\textbf{get_snapshot}(self)
API function:  outputs list of nodes, edge attributes, car 
attributes.
Output is formatted in such a way that it can be used as input 
for a new simulation.

\textbf{get_theoretical_fastest_path_A_to_B}(self, all_paths_list)
API function:  Given all_paths_list (a list of paths from A to 
B as calculated using self.get_all_paths_A_to_B()),
returns the path with the minimum total travel time (assuming no
congestion).

\textbf{get_timestamp}(self)
API function:  returns (sequential) state number.

\textbf{pause_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  forcefully halts the Car associated with 'car_id' 
until a 'resume_car' call is received.
No cars behind it may pass.

\textbf{remove_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  removes the Car associated with 'car_id' from
the simulation.
This is done by forcing it into Car.status = 'Removed from 
simulation'.

\textbf{resume_car}(self, car_id)
API function:  allows the Car associated with 'car_id' to 
resume moving.

\textbf{tick}(self)
API function:  advance state of network by one unit of time.


\end{alltt}

\section{Hidden Module: traffic\_network.py}

This module creates and runs an instance of a Network object when a simulation is created via starting a \textbf{TrafficManager} instance.  The main item here is \textbf{class Network}, which  contains, creates, and collects several dependent components (\textbf{class Node}, \textbf{class Edge}, and \textbf{class Car}).  \\

\noindent The functions here should be hidden from the user.  Instead, the user should call for changes using the\textbf{TrafficManager} API.  Internal functions belonging to the \textbf{traffic\_network} module can be seen below:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%---------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{class Network:}
\begin{alltt}

    simulation is associated with this network
    \textbf{node_ID_to_node}:  Dictionary mapping Node IDs to Node objects.
    \textbf{edge_ID_to_edge}:  Dictionary mapping Edge IDs to Edge objects.
    \textbf{car_ID_to_car}:  Dictionary mapping Car IDs to Car objects.

\textbf{add_car}(self, car)
Places Car (object) on the waiting queue for its specified 
start_edge.
Validity checks have been passed up to the TrafficManager level 
as a part of "add_car(car)",
ensuring that any Cars received are valid OR can be made valid 
using the DEFAULT_car_values_config.json file.

\textbf{add_edge}(self, edge)
Imports edge(s) from given edge dictionary.
If both the start and end nodes are already in the network, then 
the edge will be added.
Any Edge attribute values not given in the edge object (imported) 
will instead be assigned from the imported defaults file:
edge_default_config.
\textit{Note:  there are no default values for id, start_node_id, nor 
end_node_id as these are an Edge's unique identifiers.}

\textbf{add_node}(self, node)
Imports node(s) from given node dictionary and adds them to 
the network.

\textbf{all_paths_depth_first_search}(self, current_edge_ID, 
end_edge_ID, visited_list=[], valid_paths=[])
Given a start and end Edge id, return a list of all valid paths 
that do not repeat Edges.

\textbf{check_valid_car}(self, car)
Returns a detailed Exception if the given car does not conform 
to expected input structure.

\textbf{choose_path}(self, all_paths_list, metric)
Given a list of paths from A to B (ex: as calculated using
self.all_paths_depth_first_search()),
returns the "best" path with regards to input metric.
Currently supported input metrics:
    \textbf{'Fastest'}: best path = minimum total travel time (assuming 
    no congestion).
    \textbf{'Shortest'}: best path = shortest total distance in terms of 
    length.
    \textbf{'Random'}:  pay no heed to metics, choose an available path 
    at random.
Future versions may include metrics like:
    \textbf{'Fastest_now'}: best path = minimum travel time after 
    accounting for current Network congestion.

\textbf{get_Network_pointer}(self)
Returns tick index (which aligns with TrafficManager tick).

\textbf{get_edge_id}(self, edge_id)
Uses Network.edge_ID_to_edge dictionary to map an Edge ID to 
its corresponding Edge object.

\textbf{get_global_tick}(self)
Returns a pointer to this Network instance.
Useful for directly generating cars OR keeping track managing 
multiple simulations at once.

\textbf{get_node_from_id}(self, node_id)
Uses Network.node_ID_to_node dictionary to map a Node IDs to 
its corresponding Node object.

\textbf{get_snapshot}(self)
Outputs dictionary containing snapshot data for all nodes and 
edges in the network.

\textbf{path_cost_distance}(self, path_list)
Given path_list, evaluate the total distance it would take to 
travel.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is traveled.

\textbf{path_cost_minimum_time}(self, path_list)
Given path_list, evaluate the the minimum time it would take to 
travel (in ticks) given each Edge's max_speed.
Minimum time is calculated assuming a car is able to travel the 
maximum speed per edge unencumbered.
This function assumes that the entirety of each Edge is traveled 
and includes any Node-crossing time penalties.
\textit{Note:  time cost does NOT include Node-crossing time out of the 
final edge as the Car is expected to exit the Network before the 
Edge's end.}

\textbf{remove_edge}(self, edge)
Placeholder for future software version:
Will remove an Edge and all of its associated Cars from the 
Network.

\textbf{remove_node}(self, node)
Placeholder for future software version:
Will remove a Node and all of its associated inbound/outbound 
Edges from the Network.

\textbf{restore_tick_potential}(self)
Resets the tick_potential to its maximum value for all Cars on 
the Network.

\textbf{tick}(self)
Shuffles the order in which Node ticks will be processed with 
each global tick to ensure no node is favored.
\textit{Note:  global tick != Node tick.  Global tick is the unit of 
time until the next state of the simulation, 
while Node tick the proportion of that time that its components 
can move uninterrupted.  
Node ticks will occur until the sum of their durations reaches 
that of a global tick/no further movement is possible.}
